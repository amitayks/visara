# Search Implementation Complete

## What Was Done

1. **Created React Native Compatible Search Services**:
   - `phoneticMatcher.ts` - Soundex-based phonetic matching
   - `dateParser.ts` - Natural language date parsing (today, yesterday, last week, etc.)
   - `simpleSearchService.ts` - Main search service that combines all features

2. **Removed Incompatible Dependencies**:
   - Removed `@xenova/transformers` (not compatible with React Native)
   - Removed `metaphone` (ES module issues)
   - Removed all enhanced search service references

3. **Updated Components**:
   - Chat screen now uses `simpleSearchService`
   - Removed initialization code from App.tsx
   - Enhanced logging in document storage

## Features Implemented

### 1. Date Search
- "today", "yesterday"
- "this week", "last week"
- "this month", "last month"
- "last 7 days"
- Specific dates in multiple formats

### 2. Text Search
- Exact text matching in OCR content
- Vendor name matching
- Document type matching
- Phonetic matching for vendor names (handles typos)

### 3. Amount Search
- Extracts amounts from queries like "$100" or "50"
- 20% tolerance for matching

### 4. Smart Query Parsing
- Removes common words
- Extracts document types
- Parses dates and amounts
- Handles Hebrew queries

## How Search Works

1. **Query Parsing**: Extracts dates, amounts, document types, and search terms
2. **Filtering**: Applies date, amount, and type filters first
3. **Text Matching**: Searches in OCR text, vendor names, and keywords
4. **Phonetic Matching**: Uses Soundex for fuzzy vendor matching
5. **Sorting**: Results sorted by date (newest first)

## Testing the Search

Try these queries:
- "receipt" - finds all receipts
- "today" - finds documents from today
- "yesterday" - finds documents from yesterday
- "last week" - finds documents from last week
- "$50" - finds documents around $50
- Any vendor name or text from your documents

## Next Steps

1. Clean and rebuild:
```bash
# Clean caches
cd android && ./gradlew clean
cd ..
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

# Run the app
npx react-native run-android
```

2. The search should now work without errors when you:
   - Save a document
   - Search for it using the chat interface

The implementation is now fully React Native compatible and should work on both Android and iOS.
