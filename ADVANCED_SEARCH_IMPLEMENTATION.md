# Advanced Search Implementation with Vector Embeddings

## Overview
Successfully implemented a multi-layered advanced search system that combines:
- **Semantic Search**: Using vector embeddings to find documents by meaning
- **Fuzzy Search**: Handles typos and spelling mistakes  
- **Phonetic Search**: Finds documents that sound like the query
- **NLP Query Understanding**: Extracts dates, amounts, and entities from natural language

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Dependencies Added (package.json)
- `@xenova/transformers`: For on-device embeddings
- `fuse.js`: For fuzzy search
- `metaphone`: For phonetic matching
- `chrono-node`: For advanced date parsing
- `compromise`: For NLP query parsing

### 2. Core Services Created

#### `/services/search/embeddingService.ts`
- Manages transformer model loading and embedding generation
- Uses lightweight MiniLM model optimized for mobile
- Provides cosine similarity calculations
- Handles batch embedding generation

#### `/services/search/enhancedSearchService.ts`
- Main search orchestrator combining all search methods
- Pre-computes and caches document embeddings
- Parses queries to extract structured information
- Applies smart filters based on dates, amounts, document types
- Generates natural language responses

### 3. Integrations Updated

#### `/services/ai/documentProcessor.ts`
- Enhanced keyword extraction using NLP
- Generates embeddings for each processed document
- Extracts entities, organizations, people, money values

#### `/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- Updated chat interface to use enhanced search
- Added search highlights support
- Initializes search service on component mount

#### `/services/gallery/GalleryScanner.ts`
- Updates search index when new documents are saved
- Notifies search service of new documents

#### `/App.tsx`
- Initializes search service on app startup
- Ensures embeddings are ready before use

## Key Features

### 1. Semantic Search
- Converts documents and queries to vector embeddings
- Finds documents by meaning, not just keywords
- Works across languages and synonyms

### 2. Fuzzy Search
- Tolerates typos and misspellings
- Configurable threshold for match quality
- Shows partial matches with confidence scores

### 3. Phonetic Search
- Finds documents that sound like the query
- Useful for voice queries or uncertain spelling
- Uses metaphone algorithm

### 4. Smart Query Parsing
- Extracts dates: "last week", "March 2023", etc.
- Identifies amounts: "$100", "50 euros"
- Recognizes document types and vendor names
- Supports natural language queries

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Pre-computed embeddings for fast search
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Memory-conscious implementation
- Sequential processing to avoid overload

## Usage Examples

Users can now search with queries like:
- "Show me receipts from Amazon last month"
- "Find invoices over $500"
- "Search for Wallmart receipts" (handles typo)
- "Documents from yesterday"
- "מצא קבלות מהחודש האחרון" (Hebrew support)

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Offline-First**: All processing happens on-device
2. **Multi-Modal**: Combines multiple search strategies
3. **Extensible**: Easy to add new search methods
4. **Performant**: Optimized for mobile devices
5. **User-Friendly**: Natural language interface

## Next Steps

To install dependencies and test:
```bash
npm install
npx react-native run-android
# or
npx react-native run-ios
```

The search system will automatically initialize when the app starts and begin indexing existing documents.
